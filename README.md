Voting is a very important part of every democracy. It helps the citizens choose a leader to represent themselves in the government. Elections take place at various levels for the different levels of government. However, the current system of voting has several drawbacks and issues; voter turnouts are low, corruption exists and people do not end up voting for the person that they truly want to vote.
This project is about a voting system that overcomes the drawbacks of the current scenario and develops further on the advantages of the current system of voting in a country like India. The power of technology and blockchain is used to make the system faster, efficient, cleaner and much more simple.
## Highlights
- Simple and paperless candidate and voter registration.
- Easy registration for overseas voters and voting from any device with an internet connection, once acceptable proofs are provided.
- Additional transparency in the voting process - Criminal records and all forms or violence, vandalism and other activities to be projected.
- Provide a score rating for each candidate based on their records - both good and bad, over a given time frame for easier decision making
- Easy access for citizens to view details about all candidates at a single place to make informed choices.
- Vote for a particular constituency from any polling booth in the nation. Reduces the need to be physically present near the registered polling booth to vote.
- Use common identification numbers like AADHAR and SSN to eliminate the possibility of voters voting more than once across districts and states
- Immediate polling results.
- Leverage the power of Azure Blockchain services to make the process foolproof.
