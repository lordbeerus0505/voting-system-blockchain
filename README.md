Voting is a very important part of every democracy. It helps the citizens choose a leader to represent themselves in the government. Elections take place at various levels for the different levels of government. However, the current system of voting has several drawbacks and issues; voter turnouts are low, corruption exists and people do not end up voting the person that they truly want to vote for.
This project is about a voting system that overcomes the drawbacks of the current scenario and develops further on the advantages of the current system of voting in a country like India. The power of technology and blockchain is used to make the system faster, efficient, cleaner and much more simple.
